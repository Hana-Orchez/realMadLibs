    <p> Once, there was a Curious Cat and her Loving owner, Harmony. The owner, Hana, thought her Cat was very Athletic. The Cat disagreed. The Cat thought she was very Soft and Loving. The Cat Hugged the owner; the owner had no idea the Cat could speak! The owner Scratched out of his Heart in amazement! "Yeah, I can Love," said the Cat. "Yeah," said the owner. "You Love just like Eartha Kitt!"
